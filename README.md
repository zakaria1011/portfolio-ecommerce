### Full Stack E-Commerce Website with MERN

#### Project Overview

Our project is a full stack E-Commerce website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React JS, Node JS). As self-taught developers, Grari Zakaria and Ijbar Salah Eddine embarked on this journey to create an online store specializing in men's and women's clothing. They focused on creating a responsive interface for product display, cart management, and user authentication using React JS. For the backend, they implemented robust APIs with Express and Node JS, integrating MongoDB for data management. An admin panel was also built for seamless product management.

#### Architecture Overview and Technologies Used

- **Frontend (React JS):** Developed an intuitive UI for browsing products, managing carts, and facilitating user authentication using React components and Redux (or Context API) for state management.
  
- **Backend (Node.js, Express):** Implemented RESTful APIs for CRUD operations, middleware for request handling, and JWT for secure authentication.
  
- **Database (MongoDB):** Chose MongoDB for flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with Node.js applications. Designed schemas for product details, user profiles, and cart information in a non-relational format, ensuring data consistency and integrity through MongoDB transactions and atomic operations.

- **Admin Panel:** Developed a responsive UI using React components and Material UI (or Bootstrap), implementing CRUD functionalities for product management and securing admin access with role-based authentication using JWT tokens.
